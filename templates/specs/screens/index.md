# Screens Plan

List of screens for this target with routes and status.

## Instructions

- List each screen with a clear, stable name
- Add the route name (PascalCase, used for navigation and deep links)
- Spec file uses kebab-case (`item-list.md` for route `ItemList`)
- Note variants to support in mock data (for example: happy, empty, error ...)

## Screens

| Screen Name | Route | Spec File | Variants | Status |
|-------------|-------|-----------|----------|--------|
| <Name> | <Route> | <spec-file>.md | happy, empty, error | draft |

## Notes

- Add/remove rows as needed
- Keep this index in sync with `../navigation.md`
