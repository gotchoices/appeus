# Appeus Documentation

## Agents
This folder is for designing and developing the Appeus toolkit itself.
Agents working on an Appeus-guided application (where Appeus is accessible via symbolic link) should ignore this folder.

## Documentation
Documentation is structured as follows:
- Goals: `DESIGN.md` — what Appeus is trying to accomplish (and why).
- Strategy: `ARCHITECTURE.md` — the structure and approach used to achieve the goals.
- Tactics: `GENERATION.md` — how generation works in practice.

## Progress Tracking
Tasks related to development and enhancement of Appeus itself are tracked in `STATUS.md`.
