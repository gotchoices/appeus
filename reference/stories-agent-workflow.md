# Stories Agent Workflow (Appeus)

1) Read story (goal, sequence, acceptance, edge cases)
2) Check existing specs and consolidations
3) Identify screens/navigation implications
4) Create/refresh consolidations if multi-story
5) Suggest scenarios and variants
6) On request, regenerate RN screens and navigation
