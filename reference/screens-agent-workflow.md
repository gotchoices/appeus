# Screens Agent Workflow (Appeus)

Principles
- Semantic-first thinking; map to RN components
- Specs drive “how”; consolidations capture multi-story “what”

Steps
1) Check spec at design/specs/screens/<id>.md
2) Merge with design/generated/screens/<id>.md (if present)
3) Generate/refresh src/screens/<ScreenName>.tsx (on request)
4) Keep navigation consistent with design/specs/navigation.md
