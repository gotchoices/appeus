# User Guide: Specs

Specs are human-authored Markdown that clarify “how” for complex screens and navigation.

Where to put them
- Screen specs: design/specs/screens/<screen-id>.md
- Navigation spec: design/specs/navigation.md
- Global specs: design/specs/global/*

Tips
- Use frontmatter fields when structured data helps
- Include code blocks for named slots (imports/component/styles) to override defaults
- Keep prose clear and focused on outcomes
