# User Guide: Stories

Write concise, goal-oriented stories in `design/stories/` with:
- Story Overview (As a / I want / So that)
- Sequence (step-by-step)
- Acceptance Criteria
- Edge Cases

After saving, ask the agent to derive consolidations and scenarios, then regenerate when ready.

Propose screens
- Maintain a first pass list of screens/routes in `design/specs/screens/index.md` (routes in PascalCase). The agent will refine this via consolidations and specs.
