# User Guide: Navigation

Define your sitemap and deep links in `design/specs/navigation.md`.

Guidance
- Keep route names stable
- Document deep link patterns and parameters (scenario, variant)
- Clarify header titles and options per route

The agent merges this with generated navigation (derived from stories) and updates `src/navigation/*` when you request regeneration.
